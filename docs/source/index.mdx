Apollo Client for Android is a strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client for Android that supports both Java and Kotlin. [Get started with it here!](./essentials/get-started/)

Apollo Android has a Gradle Plugin to integrate into projects easily. Use Gradle docs for more details on the plugin APIs:
- [Gradle Plugin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/plugin-configuration/)
- [Deprecated Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android/blob/v1.2.3/doc/plugin-configuration.md)

Once you started, you can dive into advanced topics by going into Advanced section from the left pane.

## Getting involved

Apollo Android is a community-driven project with contributors from many companies. Check out the [blog post introducing the first public release of the project](https://blog.apollographql.com/launching-apollo-graphql-on-android-40ee0b5789bd) and the [project's README](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) to learn about the current progress.

We're excited about the idea of further [unifying the clients for JavaScript, iOS and Android](https://blog.apollographql.com/one-graphql-client-for-javascript-ios-and-android-64993c1b7991), including sharing a cache between native and React Native.
